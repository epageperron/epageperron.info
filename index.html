As PhD candidate in Assyriology at the University of Toronto, I research third millennium Mesopotamian social history, exploring administrative sources using traditional and computational approaches under the supervision of Paul-Alain Beaulieu. I hold a M.A. in Mesopotamian Studies from the University of Geneva where I wrote a thesis about the work organization in the fish industry of Early Dynastic Lagash, supervised by Antoine Cavigneaux. I also hold a B.A. in Religious Studies from the University of Quebec in Montreal. Previously Jackman Junior fellow, I now am a SSHRC doctoral awardee. I am co-PI at the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative (CDLI) and manage the Machine Translation and Automated Analysis of Cuneiform Languages (MTAAC) project.

My research interests are shared between:
- 3rd millennium BC Mesopotamia:
  - Institutions, social identity and work organization
  - Popular religion and the mother goddess
- Natural language processing of cuneiform languages;
- Corpus analysis and network analysis;
- Sumerian literature and grammar, and sign palaeography;
- Open access, open data and accessibility;
- Knowledge exchange and public humanities
